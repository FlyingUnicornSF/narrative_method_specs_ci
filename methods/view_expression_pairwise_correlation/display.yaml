    input_expression_matrix :
        ui-name : |
            Expression Matrix
        short-hint : |
            Matrix with expression values
        long-hint  : |
            Select the matrix with expression values

    input_gene_ids :
        ui-name : |
            Features
        short-hint : |
            Select the features to compare.
        long-hint  : |
            If no features are found, you probably have to associate this expression data set with a Genome.

    input_featureset :
        ui-name : |
            Feature Set
        short-hint : |
            Include all the features from this FeatureSet

    min_range :
        ui-name : |
            Min Color Range
        short-hint : |
            The color range of the heatmat will be calibrated to have this set as the minimum value

    max_range :
        ui-name : |
            Max Color Range
        short-hint : |
            The color range of the heatmat will be calibrated to have this set as the maximum value
