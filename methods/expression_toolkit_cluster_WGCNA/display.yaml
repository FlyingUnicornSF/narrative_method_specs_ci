    input_expression_matrix:
        ui-name : |
            Expression Matrix
        short-hint : |
            Select the Expression Matrix to use for hierarchical clustering
        long-hint  : |
            Choose an Expression Matrix from your Data Panel to use with this method. You can upload an Expression Matrix into your Narrative by clicking the <i>Add Data</i> button and selecting the <i>Import</i> tab.

    output_cluster_set :
        ui-name : |
            Set of clusters
        short-hint : |
            Provide name for set of clusters generated by algorithm
        long-hint  : |
            After the method has finished running, an ClusterSet data object will be added to your data panel. Provide a name for this data object, using only alphanumeric characters and underscores.

    <p>Begin by selecting or importing both the expression dataset to analyze and the genome associated with the expression dataset using the Add Data button. Provide a name for the output set of clusters. Then, Weighted Gene Co-expression Network Analysis (WGCNA) can be performed.</p>

    <p>For detailed informatoion about WGCNA, see http://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/CoexpressionNetwork/Rpackages/WGCNA/Tutorials/Simulated-00-Background.pdf</p>
    <p>This method allows users to use WGCNA to detect gene clusters from a expression matrix</p>
