            Expression Matrix
        short-hint : |
            Select the Expression Matrix for filtering differentially expressed genes
        long-hint  : |
            Choose an Expression Matrix from your Data Panel to use with this method. You can upload an Expression Matrix into your Narrative by clicking the <i>Add Data</i> button and selecting the <i>Import</i> tab. Please run the method Associate Expression Matrix to Genome Features before running this method. 
    filtered_expression:
        ui-name : |
            Filtered Expression Matrix
        short-hint : |
            Provide name for the output filtered Expression Matrix
        long-hint  : |
            After the method has finished running, an Expression Matrix data object will be added to your data panel. Provide a name for this data object, using only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
    filtered_featureset :
        ui-name : |
            Filtered FeatureSet
        short-hint : |
            Provide name for the output filtered FeatureSet object
        long-hint  : |
            After the method has finished running, a FeatureSet data object will be added to your data panel. Provide a name for this data object, using only alphanumeric characters and underscores.
    method :
        ui-name : |
            Filtering Method
        short-hint : |
            Select between the two methods to do differential expression ANOVA (ANalysis Of VAriance) or LOR (Log Odd Ratio)
    num_features :
        ui-name : |
            Number of Features
        short-hint : |
            Provide the Number of features you want to retain
        long-hint  : |
            Select either the Number of features or the p_value cutoff to filter differentially expressed genes
    p_value :
        ui-name : |
            P-value
        short-hint : |
            P-value cut off to select differentially expressed genes
        long-hint  : |
            Select either the p_value cutoff or the Number of features to filter differentially expressed genes

description : |
    <p>This method filters the differentially expressed genes from the Expression Matrix and generate a FeatureSet and reduced ExpressionMatrix</p>
    <p>Begin by selecting or importing both the expression matrix to analyze and the genome associated with the expression matrix using the Add Data button.
     Please run the method Associate Expression Matrix to Genome Features on the expression matrix before running this method. 
     Select either of the filtering method or a P-value cutoff to filter differentially expressed genes.
     Provide names for the output filtered Expression Matrix and FeatureSet object type. </p>
     
    <p>Description of filtering methods to do differential Expression: 
        <ul>
        <li>LOR : Log Odds Ratio is a statistical test that calculates the logarithm of the ratio of the odds for regulation to the odds against regulation.</li>
        <li>ANOVA : ANalysis Of VAriance is a statistical test for heterogeneity of means by analysis of group variances.</li>
    </ul></p>
