parameters :
    input_growth_matrix :
        ui-name : |
            Growth Matrix
        short-hint : |
            Select growth data matrix
        long-hint  : |
            Select the GrowthMatrix object you want to visualize

    input_value_type :
        ui-name : |
            Value type
        short-hint : |
            Either series (grouped smaples) or individual samples
        long-hint  : |
            Select series if you want to group replicated samples into single growth curve. Select samples to display individual growth curve for each sample

    input_condition_ids :
        ui-name : |
            Samples
        short-hint : |
            Select samples/series you want to view

            Select one or several samples/series to display their growth curves

    input_show_error_bar :
        ui-name : |
            Error bars
        short-hint : |
            Show error bars
        long-hint  : |

    input_log_scale :
        ui-name : |
            Log scale
        short-hint : |
            Show values in log scale
