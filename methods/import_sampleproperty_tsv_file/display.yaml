    <p>Upload a sample properties matrix from a tab-separated values (TSV) file into your Narrative. 
    <p>This file consists of two parts, Data section and Metadata section. In the Data section each row represents one time point, and each column depicts a sample. First label in the first column of the data section is "DATA". Each row has an identifier in the first column, and each column has an identifier in the first row. Other cells in the Data section contain measured values for the appropriate sample and property. The Metadata section starts with a header line that contains METADATA, Category, Property, Unit and Value column labels. All experimental conditions are described in this Metadata section.
